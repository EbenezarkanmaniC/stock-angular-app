        <h1>What is Stock Management System?</h1>
        <p>
          A Stock Management System (SMS) is a crucial tool for businesses that deal with inventory. It helps in the tracking, management, and organization of stock in real-time. By keeping track of all stock levels, businesses can minimize waste, reduce costs, and optimize the supply chain process.

These systems allow for accurate stock levels, real-time data access, and seamless integration with other business processes, making it easier to track products, forecast demand, and reduce human errors.
